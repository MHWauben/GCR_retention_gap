# Data preparation

## Uni / Bivariate visualisations

Load data, calculate variables required, and calculate a dataset which allows you to calculate trend lines over time. That is, I infer which individuals were in the workforce in any one year based on their hire date and tenure.

```{r data prep}
# Loading and calculating data
data <- read.csv('GCR.csv') %>%
  dplyr::mutate(gender = factor(gender, levels = c("M", "F")),
                gradeAtHire = as.ordered(gradeAtHire),
         age = ageAtHire + tenure,
         gend_dept = paste(gender, department, sep = "_"),
         leaveYear = hireYear + tenure,
         term = ifelse(reason == "terminated", 1, 0))
# str(data)
summary(data)

# Workforce over time: ----
all_years <- expand.grid(year = unique(c(data$hireYear, data$leaveYear)),
                         id = unique(data$id))
data_timeline <- dplyr::full_join(data, all_years, by = "id") %>%
  dplyr::filter(hireYear <= year & leaveYear >= year) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(id) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(reason = ifelse(year != max(year), NA, as.character(reason)),
                current = ifelse(year != max(year), TRUE, FALSE),
                term = ifelse(year != max(year), NA, as.numeric(term)),
                new = hireYear == year)

# Proportion of women in the workforce any year: ----
workforce_prop_timeline <- data_timeline %>%
  dplyr::group_by(year, gender) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n = n()) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(prop_workforce = n / sum(n)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(gender == "F") %>%
  dplyr::select(year, prop_workforce)


# People who have left: ----
data_left <- data[!data$current, ]
```


We assume that the business was founded in `r min(data$hireYear)`.

## Workforce over time

Calculate the proportion of women in each section of the workforce (department) in a given year, and compare that to the overall proportion of women in the whole workforce.

```{r workforce in any year}
data_dept_timeline <- data_timeline  %>%
  dplyr::group_by(year, department, gender) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n = n()) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(gender == "F") %>%
  left_join(., workforce_prop_timeline, by = "year")
ggplot(data_dept_timeline, aes(x = year, y = prop, colour = department))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_smooth(alpha = 0.25)+
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = prop_workforce), 
              colour = "red")+
  labs(title = "Proportion of female workforce over time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Proportion of workers that were female",
       colour = "Department",
       subtitle = "GCR overall proportion in shown in red")+
  BIT_theme+
  scale_colour_manual(values = strong_palette)
```

## Reasons for leaving

Starting from some basic density plots, I can calculate the proportion of leavers who are women for each separate leaving reason. This tells me whether there are specific reasons that women leave for more often than the general population. Because I saw above that there is a significant difference between the numbers of women between each department, I calculate the reasons separately for each department. 

```{r Reasons for leaving}
# Reasons for leaving by gender and department
ggplot(data_left, aes(x = gend_dept, y = reason))+
  geom_bin2d()+
  BIT_theme+
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors=strong_palette[1:2])

workforce_dept_prop_timeline <- data_timeline %>%
  dplyr::group_by(year, department, gender) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n = n()) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(prop_workforce = n / sum(n)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(gender == "F") %>%
  dplyr::select(leaveYear = year, department, prop_workforce)

all_reasons <- expand.grid(leaveYear = unique(data_left$leaveYear),
                           department = unique(data_left$department),
                           reason = unique(data_left$reason),
                           gender = unique(data_left$gender))
data_reasons <- data_left %>%
  dplyr::group_by(leaveYear, department, reason, gender) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(n = n()) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::full_join(., all_reasons, 
                   by = c("leaveYear", "department", "reason", "gender")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(n = ifelse(is.na(n), 0, n)) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(leaveYear, department, reason) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(tot = sum(n)) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::filter(gender == "F") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(prop = ifelse(tot > 0,
                              n / tot, 0)) %>%
  dplyr::left_join(., workforce_dept_prop_timeline, 
                   by = c("leaveYear", "department")) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(leaveYear, department, reason, gender)


ggplot(data_reasons, aes(x = leaveYear, y = prop, colour = reason))+
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5)+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
  geom_line(aes(x = leaveYear, y = prop_workforce), 
            colour = "red")+
  facet_wrap(department~reason)+
  labs(title = "Women as a % of all who leave for each reason",
       x = "Year of leaving",
       y = "Proportion of women",
       subtitle = "Department's overall proportion of women shown in red")+
  BIT_theme+
  scale_colour_manual(values = strong_palette)

# Significant association between gender and being terminated?
reason_assoc <- chisq.test(table(data$gender, data$term))
```

There appears to be a strong association between gender and being terminated, at a Chi squared of `r round(reason_assoc$statistic, 2)`, p `r ifelse(round(reason_assoc$p.value, 3) > 0, paste0("= ", round(reason_assoc$p.value, 3)), "< .001")`.

# Data analysis

I want to dig deeper into this association between gender and being terminated. First, I created a set of mosaic plots to explore the bivariate association between termination and other variables. Click the button below to see those.

  <div class="card card-body">

```{r characteristics of terminated people}
library("graphics")
data_dept <- as.table(as.matrix(table(data_left$department, data_left$term)))
mosaicplot(data_dept, shade = TRUE, las=2, main = "Department")
data_ageH <- as.table(as.matrix(table(data_left$ageAtHire, data_left$term)))
mosaicplot(data_ageH, shade = TRUE, las=2, main = "ageAtHire")
data_ageL <- as.table(as.matrix(table(data_left$age, data_left$term)))
mosaicplot(data_ageL, shade = TRUE, las=2, main = "ageWhenLeft")
data_year <- as.table(as.matrix(table(data_left$hireYear, data_left$term)))
mosaicplot(data_year, shade = TRUE, las=2, main = "hireYear")
data_leave <- as.table(as.matrix(table(data_left$leaveYear, data_left$term)))
mosaicplot(data_leave, shade = TRUE, las=2, main = "leaveYear")
# data_ten <- as.table(as.matrix(data_left$tenure, data_left$term))
# mosaicplot(data_ten, shade = TRUE, las=2, main = "Tenure")
data_gend <- as.table(as.matrix(table(data_left$gender, data_left$term)))
mosaicplot(data_gend, shade = TRUE, las=2, main = "Gender")
data_grade <- as.table(as.matrix(table(data_left$gradeAtHire, data_left$term)))
mosaicplot(data_grade, shade = TRUE, las=2, main = "GradeAtHire")
```

I then formalised these analyses with an ANOVA analysis on termination.

```{r anova on termination}
summary(aov(term ~ gradeAtHire * department * gender * ageAtHire * leaveYear, data = data_left))
# Main effects of department, gender, and hireYear, but 3-way interaction of GradeAtHire, gender and HireYear
```

And visualised the three-way interaction I observed in the analysis.

```{r vis termination interaction}
data_term_leave <- data_left %>%
  dplyr::group_by(leaveYear, department, gender) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(leave_left = n(),
