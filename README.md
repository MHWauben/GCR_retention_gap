# GCR_retention_gap

We are consulting with Great Circle Railways (GCR) on ways to reduce their gender inequalities. We have identified that their female staff don't tend to stay with the company as long as men do. This is partly due to women working in different areas but there is a genuine gender effect as well. BIT wants to try some ideas that will hopefully increase women's retention with GCR, and have asked for your help in justifying this decision to GCRâ€™s board.

# Task
I produced a visualisation to illustrate why we have chosen to focus on retaining women as a key business priority.
I chose a headline statistic that highlights this problem, taken from the data GCR have provided, and some visualisations that allows us to further justify this priority.
You can use any software you like as long as there is no licence fee to pay to use it for commercial purposes. Stata is also allowed. The visualisation is interactive and uses software that requires no licence fee.
