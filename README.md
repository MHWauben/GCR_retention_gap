# GCR_retention_gap

We are consulting with Great Circle Railways (GCR) on ways to reduce their gender inequalities. We have identified that their female staff don't tend to stay with the company as long as men do. This is partly due to women working in different areas but there is a genuine gender effect as well. BIT wants to try some ideas that will hopefully increase women's retention with GCR, and have asked for your help in justifying this decision to GCRâ€™s board.

# Task
Your task is to produce a visualisation that we will show to GCR's management to illustrate why we have chosen to focus on retaining women as a key business priority.
If you wish, you can also choose a headline statistic that highlights this problem, taken from the data GCR have provided.
You can use any software you like as long as there is no licence fee to pay to use it for commercial purposes. Stata is also allowed. The visualisation can be interactive or static.

You will be assessed on:
- How clearly your visualisation gets its point across
- How faithful the message is to the original data
